# TODO

* U2: Mark orientation of FTDI (Pin1 -> bottom right)
* Silkmask of test points is misplaced
* Connector P1: Provide A-B-GND orientation on silkmask
* U1: Stronger connection of GND pins to groundplane for better heat
  dissipation
* Copy all footprints to project library
* Add ferrite bead to VBUS line (see FTDI Appnote 146)
* Check power consumption - currently signaled at 90mA, can be set
  higher in FTDI EEPROM
